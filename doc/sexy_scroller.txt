*sexy_scroller.txt*	Smooth animation of the cursor and the page whenever they move, with easing.

By joeytwiddle, inspired by Terry Ma's smooth_scroll.vim, one of many
Ctrl-U/Ctrl-D scrollers.

Not to be confused with daylilyfield/sexyscroll.vim which lacks easing.

I have not yet seen any other smooth-scrolling scripts that provide easing,
operate on general movements, or use winrestview instead of
keymappings/cursorhold.


# Intro

Usually when you scroll the buffer or motion to a different part of the
document, Vim will jump there immediately.

But with SexyScroller, Vim will scroll to the new position smoothly.  As well
as looking pretty, this provides you with visual feedback about the distance
and direction in which you have travelled.


# Features

- Stable.  Never leaves you halfway through an animation.  Does not gobble your
  keystrokes.

- Does not force you to wait.  If you type additional keys while an animation
  is in progress, the script will immediately jump to the end of the animation
  and Vim will process your keystrokes normally.

# Options                                              *sexy_scroller_options*

Instead of specifying the scrolling _speed_, SexyScroller asks you to
specify how _slow_ you want scrolling to be.  You can store these options in
your .vimrc once you are happy with them.

Set the time it takes (in milliseconds) for the buffer to scroll one line or
column.

    :let g:SexyScroller_ScrollTime = 10

Set the time it takes for the cursor to travel one line.
Probably only visible if you have `:set cursorline`.  Set it to 0 to never
animate the cursor.

    :let g:SexyScroller_CursorTime = 5

(I like to pretend the cursor is "lighter" than the buffer.)

Set the maximum amount of time that longer scrolls can take:

    :let g:SexyScroller_MaxTime = 500

Choose the easing style (how scrolling accelerates and deccelerates):

    :let g:SexyScroller_EasingStyle = 2

where

  - 1 = start fast, finish slowly            (like 2 but less so)
  - 2 = start very fast, finish very slowly  (recommended, default)
  - 3 = start slowly, get faster, end slowly (sexy)
  - 4 = start very slowly, end very slowly   (like 3 but more so)
  - ? = constant speed                       (dull)

Interrupts the animation if you press a key.  Resumes the animation if they
key you pressed causes further scrolling, otherwise just jumps directly to
the destination.  Resuming animation looks best with EasingStyle 1 or 2.

    :let g:SexyScroller_DetectPendingKeys = 1   /   0

This command is provided to enable/disable the scrolling:

    :SexyScrollerToggle

Power users with fast machines may prefer to lower MaxTime to 200.  This will
make Vim feel more snappy and responsive.

Users with slower machines may like to increase MaxTime to 400 or 500, and
maybe even change the EasingStyle to 1.

For eye candy (e.g. for presentations), try MaxTime=1000, EasingStyle=3 and
increase ScrollTime as well.  This can help to visualise the distance
travelled when moving slowly and smoothly through the document.

If you are frustrated by SexyScroller slowing down mouse scrolling, you can
mitigate this issue by increasing the minimum thresholds:

    :let g:SexyScroller_MinLines = 50
    :let g:SexyScroller_MinColumns = 200

The disadvantage is that if the cursor or the window move less than these
distances, SexyScroller will not engage.

The function g:SexyScroller_ScrollToCursor(...) is available as a globally
exposed function. If you want to use this, it is useful to disable the
cursor movement related autocommands:

    :let g:SexyScroller_AutocmdsEnabled = 0


# Issues

- The script has trouble detecting a scroll event if the cursor did not move.  This is because we listen for CursorMoved events; Vim does not provide any WindowScrolled event!

  If the script does fail to detect when a scroll occurs, it will eventually notice it later, when the cursor _does_ move.  This will trigger an animation later than expected from a point which we already left some time ago.  This looks wrong!

  Since this affects `<C-E>` and `<C-Y>`, we remap them to compensate.  However if you have mapped any alternative keybinds or commands which scroll the page without moving the cursor, you will encounter this issue.  A simple workaround is to append `<BS><Space>` to any such mappings, to move the cursor and move it back again!

  Other keys similarly affected are the various `z` commands under |scroll-cursor|.  They are hard to map.

- We cannot detect the scrolling through the document that occurs during a `/` search when 'incsearch' is enabled, again due to a lack of events.  (This does not affect `n` and `N`, which work fine.)  TODO: We could temporarily disable animations when `/` or `?` are initiated and 'incsearch' is enabled (until the next CursorMoved or a CursorHold).  Alternatively, we could attempt to implement a fake `/` interface.

- I have disabled smooth horizontal animation of the cursor because I can never see the cursor when it's moving, even with 'cursorcolumn' enabled!  (Linux with both xterm and GVim.)  Scrolling in this case is pointless: it just looks like Vim is briefly frozen!  In fact the cursor is also invisible during vertical scrolling, although 'cursorline' is visible while it is moving, if enabled.  CONSIDER TODO: A workaround for both axes might be to perform the requested movement as a sequence of feedkeys(), rather than calls to winrestview.  We would need to avoid re-triggering ourself on those CursorMoved events, with :noauto or with a flag.

- PageUp, PageDown, Ctrl-U and Ctrl-D do not consistently trigger a getchar(), so DetectPendingKeys does not always work for them.  This may be system-dependent.  Simpler keystrokes like { and } never fail.  The result is that subsequent keypresses will not interrupt animation, but will start a second animation separately after the animation of the earlier keypresses.

- Plugins which use :noauto (TagList for example) will not fire CursorMoved when they actually happen.  If we then focus the window later, this will lead to late detection and an out-of-date animation being performed.

- Resizing the window may cause the topline/leftcol to change without firing a CursorMoved event, with the usual consequences.  This also happens when splitting a window.  Especially if you have scrolloff set!  TODO: Solution: Don't do any scrolling if we detect the size of the window has changed.

- With 'cursorline' enabled, the cursor will animate after a mouse click, which does not look natural.  In this case, it should simply jump without any animation.  I cannot think of any way to fix this.

- Animation does not work well with mouse scrolling.  I can't think of any way to work around this.  If you scroll with the mouse more than the keys, this plugin might start to annoy you.  But it also might be the thing that trains you to improve your Vimming.  :)

- Our ability to scroll smoothly is limited by the presence of long wrapped lines at the top of the window. (For example if line 340 is long, wrapping to 6 screen lines, then since we cannot set 'topline' to "partway through line 340", the displayed text is forced to jump 6 lines when we set 'topline' to 341.)

- Folded lines affect the effort/time-taken calculations.  So it takes MaxTime to scroll 1000 lines out of view, or move the cursor over them, even if those 1000 lines have been folded down and appear visually as one line!  TODO: To fix this we could check winline() throughout instead of winrestview()["lnum"].  NO that is a very poor check, because it is possible to jump 100 non-folded lines without the winline() changing.  Any suggestions how to fix this are welcome!

  TODO: This is quite ugly, so let's fix it.  We can use `foldclosed()` and `foldclosedend()` to detect folded lines, then we could quickly jump over them (during motion and when calculating the motion).

  Alternatively, we could unset `foldenable` so that the travel happens without folds, and then restore it to its previous state.  I wonder if this might create abnormal behaviour if the motion to within a fold would have caused it to open.

CONSIDER TODO: Make a list of exclude keys, and map them so that they set w:SexyScroller_Ignore_Next_Movement.  For example this could apply to `/` and `?` with 'hlsearch' enabled, and maybe also to `d`.

CONSIDER TODO: We could optionally enable cursorline whilst scrolling.  (Reproducing the functionality of highlight_line_after_jump.vim)

TODO: We should politely store and restore lazyredraw if we are going to continue to clobber it.
